  Gordon Gekko(played by Michael Douglas’s, his Oscar-winning role)<br/>
  in WallStreet is a Slick-haired, Armani-clad corporate-raider Gekko will stop at nothing <br />
  to make more millions: using inside information, <br />
  plundering pension funds, bribing, blackmailing and breaking the law. <br />
  Free of morals and contemptuous of his fellow man, <br />
  he lives up — or rather down — to his reptilian name.
